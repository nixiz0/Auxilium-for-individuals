# **Auxilium for Individuals**

## **Project Overview**

System designed to make optimizing and managing Large Language Models (LLMs) locally more accessible and adaptable for everyone, everywhere. This project provides a powerful system that includes:

- **Automatic Translation**: Currently supports French to English but can be adapted for other languages.
- **Reflection Chain**: A feature that can be activated or deactivated to enhance model thinking processes.
- **Advanced Document Profile Management**: Use an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to interact with your own documents effectively.
- **Custom Model Creation**: Through a guided menu, users can create their own instruction-tuned models.
- **Self-Contained System**: Everything operates seamlessly within a Docker container with an internal network.


### **For Nvidia graphics card**

For systems with NVIDIA GPUs:
- Ensure drivers are installed.
- Install CUDA 11.8 (if compatible).
